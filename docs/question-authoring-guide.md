# Question Authoring Guide

This guide explains how to add new questions, topics, and sources to the Econ 10b
study game as new course materials become available.

## Question schema

Every question in `data/questions.json` is an object with these fields:

```json
{
  "id": "class1-opportunity-cost-001",
  "topic": "econ-analysis-basics",
  "subtopic": "Opportunity Cost",
  "difficulty": "easy",
  "sourceIds": ["class1"],
  "sourceLabel": "Class 1 slides",
  "needsReview": false,
  "question": "Which statement best describes opportunity cost?",
  "choices": [
    "The dollar price paid for an activity",
    "The value of the best alternative forgone",
    "The sum of all possible alternatives forgone",
    "The average cost of all activities available"
  ],
  "answerIndex": 1,
  "correctExplanation": "Opportunity cost is the value of the best alternative forgone when choosing an activity.",
  "wrongExplanations": [
    "The dollar price may be part of opportunity cost, but it's broader than the explicit monetary price.",
    null,
    "Opportunity cost is not the combined value of every possible alternative; it is based on the best forgone alternative.",
    "Average cost is total cost divided by units, a different concept from opportunity cost."
  ],
  "tags": ["opportunity cost", "implicit cost", "explicit cost"]
}
```

Field rules:

- **`id`** — stable, unique, kebab-case. Convention: `{primary-source}-{subtopic-slug}-{3-digit-number}`.
- **`topic`** — must match an `id` in `data/topics.json`.
- **`sourceIds`** — array; every entry must match an `id` in `data/sources.json`.
- **`answerIndex`** is zero-based.
- **`choices`** and **`wrongExplanations`** must be the same length.
- **`wrongExplanations[answerIndex]` must be `null`** — the correct answer has no
  "wrong explanation" slot.
- **Every other index must have a non-empty, specific string.** Never write something
  generic like "This is wrong." Each distractor explanation should say *why* that
  specific choice is wrong, ideally naming the misconception it represents (e.g.,
  "This describes absolute advantage, not comparative advantage").
- **`difficulty`** — one of `"easy"` (direct definition/single-step recognition),
  `"medium"` (one calculation or conceptual application), or `"hard"` (multi-step
  calculation, subtle accounting distinction, or comparative-static reasoning).
- **`needsReview`** — see below.
- **`questionType`** — optional. One of `"standard"` (the default; a regular
  conceptual or graph question), `"vocab"` (a vocabulary/definition question — see
  below), or `"formula"` (a calculation/formula word problem — see below). Existing
  questions written before this field existed may omit it entirely; the app and
  validator both treat a missing `questionType` the same as `"standard"`.

## Writing vocabulary/definition questions

Set `"questionType": "vocab"` on a question when its entire point is to test whether a
student can recognize the correct definition of a term (or pick the term that matches a
given definition), rather than apply a concept to a scenario or work through a
calculation. Vocab questions power the home screen's **Vocabulary / Definitions** study
mode, which pulls every question with `questionType: "vocab"` regardless of topic.

Vocab questions still follow every other rule in this guide:

- Four choices, one clearly correct answer, no "all of the above" / "none of the above."
- A specific `correctExplanation` and a specific `wrongExplanations` entry for every
  incorrect choice — never a generic "this is wrong."
- A real `topic`, real `sourceIds`, and a real `sourceLabel` — vocab questions are just
  as source-grounded as any other question, not a separate free-floating flashcard set.

**Good vocab distractors** name a different, real term or concept from the material —
something a student could plausibly confuse the target term with:

```json
{
  "question": "Public saving is defined as:",
  "choices": ["T – G", "Y – T – C", "G – T", "Y – C – G"],
  "answerIndex": 0,
  "wrongExplanations": [
    null,
    "Y − T − C is private saving, not public saving.",
    "G − T reverses the terms; public saving is net taxes minus government spending, not the other way around.",
    "Y − C − G is national saving (private plus public combined), not public saving alone."
  ]
}
```

Each wrong choice here is a *real* formula from the same lecture, and each explanation
says exactly which other term it belongs to. That's what makes the distractor useful for
studying, not just filler.

**Bad vocab distractors** are vague, made-up, or don't correspond to anything the course
actually taught — e.g., a choice like "A type of government bond" for the term "wealth,"
with an explanation of "This is incorrect." Don't invent plausible-sounding jargon that
isn't in the source material just to fill a fourth choice.

To convert an *existing* non-vocab question to `questionType: "vocab"`, only do so if it
is genuinely a pure definition-recognition question (e.g., "X refers to:", "X is best
described as:"). Don't relabel a question that requires applying a concept to a scenario
or doing a calculation — that's still a `"standard"` question, even if it also happens to
test knowledge of a term.

## Writing formula/quantitative practice questions

Set `"questionType": "formula"` on a question whose point is a calculation or
numeric word problem built around a formula the course has taught (opportunity cost,
PPC slope, supply/demand equilibrium, GDP by any method, CPI/inflation/deflating/
indexing, real interest rates, saving/wealth identities, loanable funds, the
open-economy identities, labor productivity, compound growth/Rule of 72, value of
marginal product, user cost of capital, etc.). Formula questions power the home
screen's **Formula Practice** study mode, which pulls every question with
`questionType: "formula"` regardless of topic, and they also count normally toward
every other mode (Full Bank, Shuffle Mixed Practice, New/Unseen, Review Missed, Needs
Review, and topic-specific practice/missed-review) — Formula Practice is a filtered
view, not a separate bucket that excludes formula questions elsewhere.

A formula question still gets a real `topic` — the substantive economics topic the
formula belongs to (e.g., a CPI calculation goes under `gdp-cpi-inflation`, not a
generic "formulas" topic). Don't create a catch-all formula topic; Formula Practice
mode already provides the cross-topic view.

Rules specific to formula questions:

- **Always use fresh numbers and a fresh short scenario.** Never reuse a source's own
  worked-example figures (a slide's data table, a discussion-solution's numbers), even
  when citing that source as where the formula was taught — this is the same
  no-verbatim-answer-key rule that applies to every calculation question in this
  guide, just doubly important here since formula questions are calculations by
  definition.
- **`correctExplanation` must show the work**: name the formula, show the
  substitution with the question's actual numbers, give the resulting number, and
  give a one-line interpretation. A student should be able to learn the calculation
  method from the explanation alone, not just see the final answer confirmed.
- **Good formula distractors are wrong in a specific, teachable way** — not just a
  different number. Aim for distractors that come from a plausible calculation
  mistake:
  - using nominal instead of real (or vice versa)
  - forgetting to net out transfer payments when computing net taxes
  - confusing capital inflows with exports, or capital outflows with imports
  - using a total/average value where a marginal value is required (or the reverse)
  - confusing private saving with national saving, or public saving with private
  - reversing which alternative is "given up" in an opportunity-cost calculation
  - inverting a ratio (e.g., computing X/Y when the question asks for Y/X)
  - adding two figures that should be subtracted, or the reverse
  - stopping a multi-step calculation one step early

  Each `wrongExplanations` entry should name which specific mistake that choice
  represents, the same way non-formula distractor explanations name a misconception
  (see "Writing good distractors" below) — never just "this is the wrong number."
- **Four choices, one clearly correct answer**, same as every other question type.
  For `easy` formula questions this is usually direct substitution into a single
  formula; `medium` adds one extra step or a short interpretation; `hard` requires a
  multi-step identity, a comparison, or a trap involving the correct accounting
  category (e.g., private vs. national saving, or capital inflows vs. capital
  outflows).
- `sourceIds`/`sourceLabel` still point to wherever the formula itself is taught —
  formula questions can draw on any source where that formula appears, including
  older sources from earlier in the course, since the formula itself (not the
  specific numbers) is what's being cited.

## Writing good distractors

A good wrong-answer explanation:

- Names the specific misconception behind that choice (a common error, a swapped
  definition, an off-by-one arithmetic slip, a sign error).
- Is falsifiable against the source material — a grader could check it against the
  slides/solutions and confirm it's accurate.
- Avoids vague language ("this is incorrect", "not quite right") with no reason why.

When writing calculation questions based on a discussion-section or problem-set
solution, **don't reuse the exact numbers from the answer key.** Build a new scenario
that tests the identical skill (e.g., the same formula or the same kind of GDP
accounting trap) with different figures or a renamed scenario. This keeps the practice
bank distinct from a copy of the solutions while still being fully conservative — it's
still testing exactly what the course covered.

This rule also applies to a **lecture slide's own worked numeric example** (e.g., a
data table used to teach a formula), not just discussion-section/problem-set answer
keys. The 2026-07-06 audit found two questions that had reused a slide's or solution's
exact numbers (a calling-plan example and a phone-bill slope example) — both were
rewritten with fresh scenarios. When a slide teaches a calculation using a specific
table, write the question with new numbers that produce an analogous (not identical)
answer, even though the slide isn't a graded answer key.

## Marking `needsReview`

Set `"needsReview": true` when a question is derived from source content that was:

- Illegible or low-resolution in the original file,
- A table or chart where column/row alignment was ambiguous after extraction,
- A slide with only partial text (e.g., a title with no body content, requiring
  guesswork about what was actually taught), or
- Otherwise uncertain in a way a human should double-check before treating the
  question as verified.

When you set `needsReview: true`, also add a short note to `docs/source-notes.md`
under a "needsReview items" section describing exactly what needs confirmation (e.g.,
"Class 5, slide 12's table had merged cells that pdftotext could not disambiguate;
confirm the marginal-cost column before using this question"). Never present a
needs-review question as fully verified in the UI — the app already surfaces this via
the "Needs Review" study mode, which only appears when at least one question has the
flag set.

## Citing `sourceIds` and `sourceLabel`

- `sourceIds` is the machine-readable link to `data/sources.json` entries — always an
  array, even for a single source (e.g., `["class2"]`).
- `sourceLabel` is the human-readable citation shown in the quiz UI (e.g., "Class 2
  slides", "Discussion Session 1 Solutions"). Keep it short and consistent with how
  other questions from the same source are labeled.
- If a question draws on more than one source (e.g., a concept from lecture applied
  via a discussion-section example), list both in `sourceIds` and use a combined
  `sourceLabel` like `"Class 3 and Class 4 slides"`.

## Adding a new topic

1. Add an entry to `data/topics.json`:
   ```json
   { "id": "new-topic-slug", "name": "Human-Readable Topic Name", "description": "One sentence description." }
   ```
2. Use a stable, kebab-case `id` — this is what questions reference in their `topic`
   field, and it should never be renamed once questions use it (renaming breaks the
   reference; add a new topic instead if the scope changes significantly).
3. Add questions with `"topic": "new-topic-slug"`.

## Adding a new source

1. Add an entry to `data/sources.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "id": "new-source-id",
     "filename": "OriginalFileName.pptx",
     "title": "Human-readable title",
     "type": "lecture-slides",
     "coverageSummary": "One or two sentences on what this file covers.",
     "dateAdded": "YYYY-MM-DD",
     "reliabilityNotes": "Any extraction issues, illegible sections, or caveats."
   }
   ```
2. Extract the file's text before writing questions — don't write questions from
   memory or assumption about what a slide deck "probably" contains.
3. Update `docs/source-notes.md` with a summary of what topics the new material covers
   and any sections that were unreadable or ambiguous.
4. Add new questions referencing the new source id, and update the "Initial question
   bank" counts in `README.md` and the `CHANGELOG.md` entry for the change.

## Running the validation checks

Open the app in a browser and check the console. `src/data.js` runs schema validation
on every page load and logs any problems as `console.warn` (never shown to the
student). Before committing new questions, load the app locally and confirm the
console reports something like:

```
[Econ 10b question bank validation] 123 questions passed all checks.
```

If it instead lists issues, fix them before committing — the validator checks for
missing required fields, out-of-range `answerIndex`, mismatched `choices`/
`wrongExplanations` lengths, a non-null explanation at the correct answer's index,
empty explanations at incorrect indices, unknown `topic`/`sourceIds` references, and an
invalid `questionType` (anything other than `"standard"`, `"vocab"`, `"formula"`, or
omitted).

The same checks (plus vocab- and formula-question counts) run via
`node scripts/validate-data.mjs` from the command line — run it before every commit
that touches `data/`.
